# External File Interpretur
# Only Takes Text Files

Takes an input of text file and interprets it into a numbered list
There is no checking on the splitter, so if you just hit enter, if you use the included Name list you will get
an output file that is over a million lines long. So watch out for that.

There will be no updates unless I think of more things to add.
